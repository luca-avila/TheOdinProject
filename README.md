# The Odin Project – My Web Development Journey

This repository contains all the exercises, mini-projects, and practice work I’ve completed while following [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.

🧠 I'm using this repo to track my progress and solidify my foundations in **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git**, and eventually **fullstack development**.

---

## 🎯 Goal

My goal is to become a **job-ready fullstack developer** by combining The Odin Project with personal fullstack projects built using **Flask (Python)** and **modern frontend tools (HTML/CSS/JS)**.

---

## ⚠️ Note

This is **not** a showcase of polished apps. It’s a **learning repo** to document my progress, experiments, and problem-solving as I go through the curriculum.

If you're interested in my real-world projects, check out my main repositories [here](https://github.com/luca-avila).
